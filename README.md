# Expobavio web site

> This project is proposed by Microverse as capstone project for the first module. The topic I chose to work on is creating a website for a rural exhibition that took place in my town every year before Covid. The design was obtained from [this template](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).
